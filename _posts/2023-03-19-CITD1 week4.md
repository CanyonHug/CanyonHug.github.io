- Convergence IT Design 1 course Week4 summary


# 1. Project plan (Week4 plan)

Weekly plan of the project

- Week 2, 3 : set a specific goal and study basic concepts of cryptocurrency and RL
- Week 3 : Investigating previous research (stock trading AI, other cryptocurrency trading AI)
- **Week 4 : Designing candidate RL models**  
- Week 5, 6 : Implementing and learning RL models   
- Week 7 : Identifying Model Issues
- Week 8 : midterm
- Week 9, 10 : Solve model issues, improve performance
- Week 11, 12 : Model Completion and Performance Analysis

Week4 plan was '**Designing candidate RL models**'. 


# 2. Designing candidate RL models  
As the environment of cryptocurrency market is very complicated, it seems reasonable to use **model-free RL**. In addition, '**Q-learning**' looks better than '**policy optimization**' to use data efficiently.

Even if Q-learning does not require a model of the market and hence has **fewer assumptions on the price dynamics** than the closed-form sollutions, traditional RL techniques are limitted by **the curse of dimensionality**. (The Q-table grows enormously.)

The **Deep Q-Network (DQN)** combines the **deep neural network** and the **Q-learning**. It can address the curse of dimensionality challenge faced by Q-learning.

So, I will use **DQN based model**.

Furthermore, I should consider **Zero-ending inventory constraint** as the paper '[A Deep Reinforcement Learning Framework for Optimal Trade Execution](../DRL-for-execution)' said.  

> The **Zero-ending inventory constraint** means that there should be **no remaining inventory when the execution period ends**.


# 3. basic NN algorithm simulation on numer.ai

<https://numer.ai>

'**numer.ai**' is a **crowdsourced AI hedge** fund that operates based on the predictions of data scientists around the world.

**The classic Numerai tournament** provides you with anonymized data that can be modeled using machine learning. 

**Numerai Signals** generalizes this idea and allows you to use the data you want. This allows data scientists to use data sources and modeling techniques creatively

> using numer.ai services, I can practice how to make models using financial data.


# 4. Next week's plan (Week 4) 

- **Implementing and learning RL models**  
  - Prototype RL algorithm making  
  - implementing on numer.ai  
  - model ensemble  

> I think, it might be imposibble to implement and learn RL models next week.
