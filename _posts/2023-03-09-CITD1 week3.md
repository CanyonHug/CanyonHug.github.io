- Convergence IT Design 1 course Week3 summary


# 1. Project plan (Week3 plan)

Weekly plan of the project

- **Week 2, 3 : set a specific goal** and study basic concepts of cryptocurrency and RL
- **Week 3 : Investigating previous research (stock trading AI, other cryptocurrency trading AI)**
- Week 4 : Designing candidate RL models  
- Week 5, 6 : Implementing and learning RL models   
- Week 7 : Identifying Model Issues
- Week 8 : midterm
- Week 9, 10 : Solve model issues, improve performance
- Week 11, 12 : Model Completion and Performance Analysis

Week3 plan was '**setting a specific goal and investigating previous research**'. 

On Week 3, I set a specific goal and investigate previous research papers.

> I think I have a lot of papers to read and summerize.


# 2. Setting a specific goal  
The topic was '**establishment of virtual asset order execution system using Reinfocement Learning**'.

I set a specific goal as '**cryptocurrency execution in CEX using RL**' and '**executing 70% price between Low-High prices in 10-min candle chart**'.

There are some concepts to know.  
- candle chart  

![candle chart](/assets/images/candle-chart.png){: width="50%" height="50%" .align-center}

- **execution** : buying or selling coins or tokens on a reasonable prices, given the 'amount of a particular stock to buy' and the 'specific period'  
- **alpha search** : trading for revenue with risk 

> For **dimensionality reduction**, only **one of the buying and selling** of the execution can be performed or the given **specific period** can be set as a **constant**.  

> Recent cryptocurrency AI models for revenue (**alpha search**) use **Knowledge Base** (Deterministic Logic)  
>> It would be great to implement alpha search using RL in next CITD courses

- **CEX** : Centralized EXchange, it offers cryptocurrency exchange servies to registered users. 
  - It matches buyers and sellers with an order book.
  - ex) Binance, coinone, upbit
- **DEX** : Decentralized EXchange, peer-to-peer(P2P) marketplaces  
  - in DEX, transactions are facilitated through the use of self-executing agreements written in code called '**smart contracts**'
  - ex) Uniswap, dYdX, Curve Finance

**The reference of the performance** would be a **10-min VWAP**.
- **VWAP** : Volume Weighted Average Price, the ratio of the value of a security or financial asset traded to the total volume of transactions during a trading session(measure of the average trading price for the period)  
  - trading benchmark by investors who aim to be as passive as possible in their execution  
  - ![VWAP](/assets/images/VWAP.png)  

- **TWAP** : Time Weighted Average Price, the average price of a security over a specified time  
  - TWAP orders are a strategy of **executing trades evenly over a specified time period**  
  - TWAP strategy is often used to **minimize a large order's impact on the market and result in price improvement**.

- **limit order** : an order to buy or sell a security at a specific price

other components  
- ML Framework : pytorch  
- input data : orderbook snap shot sequence (pandas DataFrame) provided by Superpetual  
  - ![input data](/assets/images/input-data.png){: weight="30%", height="30%"}  
  - ![input data2](/assets/images/input-data2.png){: weight="30%", height="30%"}  
  - ![input data3](/assets/images/input-data3.png){: weight="30%", height="30%"}

# 3. Investigating previous researches
papers related to RL, stock trading AI and cryptocurrency trading AI

- **RL paper**  
  - - -      
  - '**The Advance of Reinforcement Learning and Deep Reinforcement Learning**'  
    (2022 IEEE international Conference on Electrical Engineering, Big Data and Algorithms (EEBDA))  
    link : [advance of RL and DRL](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9744760)  

- **stock trading AI paper**  
  - - -
  - '**A Deep Reinforcement Learning Framework for Optimal Trade Execution**'  
    (Machine Learning and Knowledge Discovery in Databases. Applied Data Science and Demo Track: European Conference, ECML PKDD 2020, Ghent, Belgium, September 14–18, 2020, Proceedings, Part V Sep 2020 Pages 223–240)  
    link : [DRL for execution](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-67670-4_14)
    > suggested from a mentor of Superpetual

> I think I will probably make an algorithm using **DQN**.

# 4. Next week's plan (Week 4) 

- **Designing candidate RL models**  
  - Prototype RL algorithm making  
  - Learning RL models using orderbook data  
  - Performance checking using 10 min-VWAP  

> It seems necessary to summerize the above papers. I haven't quite understood them yet.
