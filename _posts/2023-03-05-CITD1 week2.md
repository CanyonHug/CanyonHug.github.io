# 1. Project plan (Week2 plan)

Weekly plan of the project

- **Week 2, 3 : set a specific goal and study basic concepts of cryptocurrency and RL**
- Week 3 : Investigating previous research (stock trading AI, other cryptocurrency trading AI)
- Week 4 : Designing candidate RL models  
- Week 5, 6 : Implementing and learning RL models   
- Week 7 : Identifying Model Issues
- Week 8 : midterm
- Week 9, 10 : Solve model issues, improve performance
- Week 11, 12 : Model Completion and Performance Analysis

Week2 plan was '**setting a specific goal and studying basic concepts of cryptocurrency and RL**'. 

On Week 2, I mainly conducted a simple survey on cryptocurrency and reinforcement learning. In order to set specific goals, I thought that understanding the approximate structure through investigation should be preceded.

> I think it would be better to set specific goals in Week 3.


# 2. Surveying basic concepts of the topic  
I need to know 'what virtual assets are' and 'what RL is'.

## 2-1. virtual assets  
**Virtual Assets** : **a digital representation of an item** that has value in a **specific environment**

- This medium of exchange or property can be digitally traded, transferred or used for payment for investment purposes.  
- The most common example of a virtual asset is '**virtual currency**' (Bitcoin, Ethereum or Dogecoin), '**Gaming tokens**', '**non-fungible tokens(NFTs)**' and '**governance tokens**'

> Nexon cash is one of the virtual assets.

## 2-2. Cryptocurrency

**Cryptocurrency** : : **a digital currency** in which transactions are verified and records maintained by '**a decentralized system**' using cryptography, rather than by a centralized authority.

- Individual coin ownership records are stored in **a digital ledger**, 
which is a computerized database using strong cryptography to secure transaction records, control the creation of additional coins, and verify the transfer of coin ownership.

- The first cryptocurrency is '**Bitcoin**', which was created by Satoshi Nakamoto. 
  - ['Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System' paper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf)

> There are videos that explain cryptocurrency and blockchain. ([youtube clips](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7jH19IHhOLOJfXeVqjtiawzNQLxOgTdq))  
> There is a [website](https://brunch.co.kr/@ella-park) explaining cryptocurrencies


## 2-3. Reinforcement Learning (RL)

![RL icon](/assets/images/RL.png){: width="30%" height="30%" .align-center}

**Reinforcement Learning (RL)** : a area of '**machine learning**' concerned with how **intelligent agents** ought to take **actions** in **an environment** in order to **maximize the notion of cumulative reward**

![RL 2 icon](/assets/images/RL-2.png){: width="30%" height="30%" .align-center}

In this case,
- Agent : virtual assets trader  
- Action : buying and selling
- Reward : gains and losses on saling
- State : virtual assets transaction status
- Environment : virtual assets trading market 


![RL components](/assets/images/RL-components.png){: width="40%" height="40%" .align-center}

- **State** : a vector to describe the current status of the environment

- **Policy** : a rule used by an agent to decide what actions to take. It can be deterministic or stochastic.  

  - **Deterministic policy** : one action for a given state,  
  
  $$ a_t = \mu(s_t) $$
  
  - **Stochastic policy** : a probability distribution of actions for a given state  
  
  $$ a_t \sim \pi(\cdot|s_t) $$
  
  In deep RL, we deal with **parameterized policies**. (policies whose outputs are **computable functions** that depend on **a set of parameters** (eg the weights and biases of a neural network) which we can adjust to change the behavior via some optimization algorithm.)

  We often denote the parameters of such a policy by $\theta$ or $\phi$, and then write this as a subscript on the policy symbol to highlight the connection:  

  $$ a_t = \mu_\theta(s_t) $$

  $$ a_t \sim \pi_\theta(\cdot|s_t) $$
  



> Open AI spinning up RL informations ([RL algorithms](https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/spinningup/rl_intro2.html))

> The setting of RL models is likely to be the core of this project.



# 3. Next week's plan (Week 3) 

- **Setting a specific goal**  
  - Selecting which virtual assets to trade (maybe itâ€™ll be the cryptocurrency)  
  - What will be the final form? (an application, an algorithm, or program code)  
  - Selecting which platforms to use (CEX or DEX)  
  - Setting a goal of the program : 10 minutes VWAP(Volume Weighted Average Price) as a reference  

- **Investigating previous research**  
  - Learning how stock trading AI works  
  - Learning what other Cryptocurrency trading AIs are  
  - Finding improvements differentiation in the latest research findings  

> I think I can move forward quickly only if I finish the survey quickly
