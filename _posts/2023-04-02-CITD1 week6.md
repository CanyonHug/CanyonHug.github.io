- Convergence IT Design 1 course Week6 summary


# 1. Project plan (Week6 plan)

Weekly plan of the project

- Week 2, 3 : set a specific goal and study basic concepts of cryptocurrency and RL
- Week 3 : Investigating previous research (stock trading AI, other cryptocurrency trading AI)
- Week 4 : Designing candidate RL models  
- **Week 5, 6 : making a simulator (learning environment for agent)**   
- Week 6, 7 : learning the agent on the simulator   
- Week 8 : midterm   
- Week 9, 10 : testing the model using real data   
- Week 11, 12 : Model Completion and Performance Analysis


# 2. Making a simulator

- **Simulator Settings**  
  - a timestep : 1s  
  - a episode : 10 min 

  After 10 minutes, the agent get accumulated rewards based on LOB data.

  The 10 minutes LOB data is sampled from 1 month LOB data.

- **Week 5, 6 : making a simulator (learning environment for agent)**    
- **Week 6, 7 : learning the agent on the simulator**   
- Week 8 : midterm    
- Week 9, 10 : testing the model using real data    
- Week 11, 12 : Model
