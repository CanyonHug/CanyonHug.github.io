> Comparing the executed prices with High prices and Low prices of 100 5min LOB data.

> Comparing the executed prices with Middle prices of 100 5min LOB data.

- - -
**Discussion**  
- the agent policy converges to middle prices  
- success rate (lower than middle price) : 53%  

> The reason why the policy of agent converges to middle prices might be that the actions were TWAP based, so it follows the TWAP strategy.  

> To improve the policy of the agent, actions should be changed from TWAP based to large range of quantity.


# 3. Next Plan
- Make a system that can execute various cryptocurrencies   
- Make a RL system that can make earnings by trading
