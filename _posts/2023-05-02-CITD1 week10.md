# 1. Project plan (Week10 plan)

Weekly plan of the project

- Week 8 : midterm  
- Week 9 : **Completing the model and simulator and Training the model**  
- **Week 10, 11 : Testing the model and modifying the model**  
- Week 12 : Model Completion and Performance Analysis



# 2. Loading a data  

I wanted to make a simulator to train the DQN agent **using binance bitcoin Limit orderbook data**(2023.3.1 - 2023.4.1).

To get future LOB data, I should do a survey and get a permission from binance. However, I couldn't get any reply from binance. I asked my mentor for help, but the mentor's situation was the same, so I modified the method.

- **using websocket to load LOB data**  
  My mentor suggest to use binance websocket api to get real-time LOB dWata using asyncio module. At first, I considered AWS ec2 server for saving LOB data but as I was doing it, I saved it locally.

  > binance websocket api docs : <https://binance-docs.github.io/apidocs/futures/en/#websocket-market-streams>

- **5 min LOB structure**  
  I planned 10 min execution, however there was only 5min interval or 15min interval kline code. So I changed it to **5min execution**. Fortunately, limit depth order book updated every 0.5s so the number of state wasn't changed. (60 * 5 * 2 = 600)  

  - **10 depth bid/ask prices** (updated every 0.5s)  
    - - -
    partial book depth streams : Top bids and asks  
    update speed : 250ms, 500ms or 100ms  
    Stream Names: <"symbol">@depth<"levels"> OR <"symbol">@depth<"levels">@500ms OR <"symbol">@depth<"levels">@100ms

  - **5 min kline data**

    kline data consists of many information about trading for specific interval.  
    
    url = 'https://fapi.binance.com/fapi/v1/klines'

    $\rightarrow$ data format
    ```

- **binance websocket code for 5min LOB**   
  There was an error that the start time of kline data using websocket wasn't changed. So I got kline data on main.py using other api not a websocket.

  ```python
  import asyncio
  import json
  import pandas as pd
  import websockets
  from datetime import datetime

  async def save_order_book():
      # partial book depth stream
      # update speed: 500ms = 0.5s
      url = 'wss://fstream.binance.com/ws/btcusdt@depth10@500ms'  # Replace with your desired symbol and depth level
      kline_url = 'wss://fstream.binance.com/ws/btcusdt@kline_5m' # for kline data using at last step

      
      num = 1   # should be updated as the last number of the file + 1

      while True:
          data = []

          try:
              websocket = await websockets.connect(url)
              kline_websocket = await websockets.connect(kline_url)

              while True:
                  response = await websocket.recv()
                  order_book = json.loads(response)

                  # Append the order book data
                  data.append(order_book)

                  # Convert to pandas DataFrame every 10 minutes
                  if len(data) % 600 == 0:  # 5 minutes = 5 * 60 seconds = 5 * 60 * 2 = 600 (0.5 seconds)
                      kline_response = await kline_websocket.recv()
                      kline = json.loads(kline_response)
                      data.append(kline)

                      df = pd.DataFrame(data)
                      now = datetime.now()
                      df.to_json(f'./LOB/{num}.json')
                      print(f"{now.year}-{now.month}-{now.day}-{now.hour}-{now.minute} Order book data saved to JSON file.")
                      data = []  # Reset data
                      num += 1

          except websockets.exceptions.ConnectionClosedOK:
              print("WebSocket connection closed. Reconnecting...")
              continue

          except websockets.exceptions.WebSocketException as e:
              print(f"WebSocket exception occurred: {e}")
              continue

          except Exception as e:
              print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
              continue

  async def main():
      await save_order_book()

  asyncio.run(main())
  ```
> I stacked 600 5min LOB data. 500 for training and 100 for testing.  
> There was an error that the websocket kline data was not correspond to the period of 5min LOB data, cause the websocket kline data was updated when only there was any updating on the LOB. I loaded the kline data seperatly on the main.py file.

# 3. Next week's plan (Week 11) 

- Week 11 : **Completing the model and simulator and Training the model**  
- Week 12, 13 : Testing the model and modifying the model  
- Week 14 : Model Completion and Performance Analysis

> First, I am going to complete the DQN model and then, complete the simulator.
